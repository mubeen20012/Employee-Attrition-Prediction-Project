Employee Attrition Prediction & Dashboard

This project predicts employee attrition using Gradient Boosting with SMOTE to handle class imbalance, achieving 89% accuracy. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation with classification metrics.

A Streamlit dashboard allows users to input employee details and visualize HR insights, including attrition distribution, department-wise active employees, and trends in age, income, and tenure. Run the app with:
